# Technical Specification for Trademark and Copyright Management Platform on Solana using Metaplex Core SDK

## Introduction

This specification outlines the design and implementation of a platform for managing **trademarks** and **copyrights** on the Solana blockchain using the **Metaplex Core SDK**. The system provides features for minting, managing, and transferring IP assets while integrating with global regulatory bodies (e.g., WIPO, ARIPO) for verification and filing. The platform leverages Metaplex SDK’s **plugin system**, **collections**, and **royalty enforcement** for automated asset management.

The IP assets will have specific metadata depending on the type (trademark or copyright) and comply with best practices in REST API design.

---

## 1. REST API Design Overview

The platform will follow RESTful conventions, with resource-based endpoints specific to trademarks and copyrights. Each asset type will have its own set of endpoints, and the actions such as **create**, **update**, **transfer**, and **royalty management** will be mapped to appropriate HTTP methods.

### 1.1 Core REST API Principles

- **Resource-based URLs**: `/trademarks`, `/copyrights`
- **Standard HTTP methods**:
  - `POST`: Create a new resource.
  - `GET`: Retrieve a resource.
  - `PUT`: Update a resource.
  - `DELETE`: Remove a resource.

---

## 2. IP Resource Endpoints

### 2.1 Create IP Asset (Trademarks & Copyrights)

This endpoint creates a new IP asset on-chain. Before minting, the platform will check with regulatory bodies (WIPO, ARIPO) to ensure that the asset doesn’t already exist.

#### **Endpoint**: `POST /trademarks` or `POST /copyrights`

- **Core Function**: Creates an NFT representing an IP asset (trademark or copyright) on the Solana blockchain.
- **Regulatory Check**: Verify with the relevant body (WIPO/ARIPO) before minting.
- **Metadata**:
  - Trademarks: Requires jurisdiction, expiry date, and registration number.
  - Copyrights: Requires creation date, author name, and registration status.

#### **Payload** (Example for a trademark)

```json
{
	"name": "Trademark XYZ",
	"uri": "https://arweave.net/trademark_xyz_metadata",
	"owner": "owner_public_key",
	"jurisdiction": "US",
	"expiry_date": "2030-12-31",
	"registration_number": "US1234567",
	"royalty_percentage": 5
}
```

#### **Metaplex SDK Example (JavaScript)**

```javascript
/**
 * Create a trademark on-chain
 * @param {Object} assetDetails - Details of the IP asset.
 * @returns {Promise} Transaction confirmation.
 */
const createTrademark = async (assetDetails) => {
	const assetSigner = generateSigner(umi);
	return await create(umi, {
		asset: assetSigner,
		name: assetDetails.name,
		uri: assetDetails.uri, // points to metadata stored in Arweave
		sellerFeeBasisPoints: assetDetails.royalty_percentage * 100, // Royalty percentage in basis points
		creators: [{ address: assetDetails.owner, share: 100 }],
		metadata: {
			jurisdiction: assetDetails.jurisdiction,
			expiryDate: assetDetails.expiry_date,
			registrationNumber: assetDetails.registration_number
		}
	}).sendAndConfirm(umi);
};
```

#### **Flow Diagram**

```plaintext
User Request → API → Check with WIPO/ARIPO → Mint NFT using Metaplex SDK → Store Metadata on Arweave
```

---

### 2.2 Fetch IP Asset

Fetches metadata for a specific IP asset (trademark or copyright).

#### **Endpoint**: `GET /trademarks/{asset_id}` or `GET /copyrights/{asset_id}`

- **Description**: Fetches metadata for the specified IP asset.

#### **Metaplex SDK Example**

```javascript
/**
 * Fetch metadata of a trademark from the chain
 * @param {string} assetId - The mint address of the trademark.
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Trademark metadata.
 */
const fetchTrademark = async (assetId) => {
	const asset = await fetchAssetV1(umi, assetId);
	return asset;
};
```

---

### 2.3 Update IP Asset

Modifies the metadata or royalties for an existing IP asset (e.g., renewal of trademarks, updating author information for copyrights).

#### **Endpoint**: `PUT /trademarks/{asset_id}` or `PUT /copyrights/{asset_id}`

- **Core Function**: Updates the metadata for an existing IP asset.

#### **Payload** (Example for a trademark)

```json
{
	"name": "Updated Trademark XYZ",
	"uri": "https://arweave.net/updated_trademark_xyz_metadata",
	"expiry_date": "2035-12-31",
	"registration_number": "US1234567",
	"royalty_percentage": 6
}
```

#### **Metaplex SDK Example**

```javascript
/**
 * Update metadata of a trademark
 * @param {string} assetId - The mint address of the trademark.
 * @param {Object} updatedDetails - Updated trademark details.
 * @returns {Promise} Transaction confirmation.
 */
const updateTrademark = async (assetId, updatedDetails) => {
	const asset = await fetchAssetV1(umi, assetId);
	return await updateAsset(umi, {
		asset,
		uri: updatedDetails.uri,
		sellerFeeBasisPoints: updatedDetails.royalty_percentage * 100,
		metadata: {
			expiryDate: updatedDetails.expiry_date,
			registrationNumber: updatedDetails.registration_number
		}
	}).sendAndConfirm(umi);
};
```

---

### 2.4 Transfer IP Asset

Transfers ownership of a trademark or copyright.

#### **Endpoint**: `POST /trademarks/{asset_id}/transfer` or `POST /copyrights/{asset_id}/transfer`

- **Core Function**: Transfers ownership of an IP asset to a new wallet.

#### **Payload**

```json
{
	"new_owner": "new_owner_public_key"
}
```

#### **Metaplex SDK Example**

```javascript
/**
 * Transfer ownership of a trademark
 * @param {string} assetId - The mint address of the trademark.
 * @param {string} newOwner - The public key of the new owner.
 * @returns {Promise} Transaction confirmation.
 */
const transferTrademark = async (assetId, newOwner) => {
	const asset = await fetchAssetV1(umi, assetId);
	return await transferAsset(umi, {
		asset,
		newOwner
	}).sendAndConfirm(umi);
};
```

---

## 3. Plugins for Custom Behavior

### 3.1 Royalties Plugin

Leverage the **Royalties Plugin** to automate royalty distribution when an IP asset is used commercially.

- **Plugin Setup Example**:

```javascript
const royaltiesPlugin = {
	type: 'Royalties',
	basisPoints: 500, // 5% royalty
	creators: [{ address: ownerPublicKey, share: 100 }]
};
await create(umi, {
	asset: assetSigner,
	plugins: [royaltiesPlugin]
}).sendAndConfirm(umi);
```

---

## 4. Compliance and Regulatory Checks

The platform will need to interact with bodies like **WIPO** or **ARIPO** to ensure compliance and avoid duplicate IP registration. The system will perform a **pre-mint check** to validate the uniqueness of the IP, and after minting, it will file the registration with the relevant body.

### 4.1 Pre-Mint Check

Before minting, the system checks whether the IP already exists with regulatory bodies.

#### **Endpoint**: `POST /trademarks/verify`

- **Description**: Verify with WIPO/ARIPO whether the IP is already registered.

#### **Flow Diagram**

```plaintext
User Request → API → WIPO/ARIPO API → Response (Exists or Not) → Proceed with Minting
```

---

### 5. System Architecture Overview

The platform consists of several components, each with a distinct role in ensuring the smooth operation of trademark and copyright management. Below is a detailed description of each part of the system.

#### **5.1 System Components**

1. **Frontend**:

   - User interface (UI) where intellectual property (IP) holders can manage their trademarks and copyrights, report infringements, view royalties, transfer ownership, and renew assets.
   - Interacts with the API layer to fetch information and display real-time data.
   - Ensures ease of use and accessibility for non-technical users.

2. **API Layer**:

   - Facilitates communication between the frontend and the blockchain.
   - Exposes the REST API endpoints for:
     - Creating, fetching, updating, transferring, and renewing IP assets.
     - Reporting IP infringements.
     - Setting and managing royalties for IP.
     - Integrating with external regulatory bodies (WIPO/ARIPO) for validation and filing.
   - Middleware handles verification, validation, and authentication before interacting with the blockchain.

3. **Blockchain Layer (Solana)**:

   - Handles all on-chain activities, including minting IP assets (trademarks, copyrights) as NFTs, transferring ownership, updating metadata, and managing royalties.
   - Uses the **Metaplex Core SDK** to create, fetch, and update IP-related NFTs on Solana.

4. **Storage Layer**:

   - Metadata and legal documents (such as trademark registration certificates) are stored in a decentralized manner, using **Arweave** as the default storage solution, ensuring immutability and long-term storage.

5. **External APIs**:
   - **WIPO/ARIPO APIs**: Used to check for existing IP registrations before creating a new IP asset. After the asset is minted, it can be filed with the relevant regulatory bodies through these APIs.

#### **5.2 Architectural Flow Diagram**

```plaintext
[Frontend] → [API Layer] → [Metaplex SDK / Solana] → [Blockchain]

### 6. Lifecycle Events for Trademarks and Copyrights

Both **trademarks** and **copyrights** follow distinct lifecycle stages. While there are shared events, some events are unique to each. This section highlights how the platform handles lifecycle events for both IP types.

#### 6.1 Common Lifecycle Events

These events are common to both **trademarks** and **copyrights**:

- **Create**: When the IP asset is first minted.
- **Transfer**: Ownership of the IP is transferred to another party.
- **Renewal**: The IP asset (e.g., trademark) is renewed.
- **Infringement Reporting**: When a dispute or infringement occurs, it can be reported and associated with the IP.

##### 6.1.1 Renew IP Asset

For trademarks, renewal is a critical event, as they expire after a period (e.g., 10 years). Copyrights typically last longer but may also require updates in some jurisdictions.

**Endpoint**: `POST /trademarks/{asset_id}/renew`

- **Description**: Renews the trademark’s on-chain metadata, including updating its expiry date.

**Payload**:

```json
{
	"new_expiry_date": "2040-12-31"
}
```

**Metaplex SDK Example**:

```javascript
/**
 * Renew the trademark by updating its expiry date
 * @param {string} assetId - The mint address of the trademark.
 * @param {string} newExpiryDate - The new expiry date.
 * @returns {Promise} Transaction confirmation.
 */
const renewTrademark = async (assetId, newExpiryDate) => {
	const asset = await fetchAssetV1(umi, assetId);
	return await updateAsset(umi, {
		asset,
		metadata: { expiryDate: newExpiryDate }
	}).sendAndConfirm(umi);
};
```

##### 6.1.2 Infringement Reporting

Infringement reporting is crucial for protecting IP rights. If an infringement is reported, it may be linked to the IP asset, and the **Freeze Delegate Plugin** can be used to halt transfers or commercial use until the dispute is resolved.

**Endpoint**: `POST /trademarks/{asset_id}/infringements`

- **Description**: Files an infringement report against the IP asset, including evidence and a description.

**Payload**:

```json
{
	"description": "Unauthorized use of trademark in a different jurisdiction",
	"evidence_url": "https://example.com/evidence"
}
```

**Metaplex SDK Example**:

```javascript
/**
 * File an infringement report for a trademark
 * @param {string} assetId - The mint address of the trademark.
 * @param {Object} reportDetails - Details of the infringement report.
 * @returns {Promise} Transaction confirmation.
 */
const reportInfringement = async (assetId, reportDetails) => {
	const asset = await fetchAssetV1(umi, assetId);
	// Store evidence on Arweave or IPFS and link it in metadata
	return await updateAsset(umi, {
		asset,
		metadata: {
			infringementReport: {
				description: reportDetails.description,
				evidence: reportDetails.evidence_url
			}
		}
	}).sendAndConfirm(umi);
};
```

##### 6.1.3 Transfer Ownership

The platform allows transferring ownership of trademarks and copyrights.

**Endpoint**: `POST /trademarks/{asset_id}/transfer`

- **Description**: Transfers the ownership of the IP asset to another party.

---

### 7. Advanced Custom Plugin Handling

Metaplex's plugin system allows us to extend the functionality of IP assets. While plugins like **Royalties** and **Freeze Delegate** are already part of the system, there may be cases where you need custom behavior.

#### 7.1 Royalties and Licensing

For automated royalty collection, the **Royalties Plugin** distributes payments every time an IP asset is commercially used or sold.

#### 7.2 Custom Behavior with Plugins

If existing plugins don't cover your requirements, Metaplex allows you to create and attach **custom plugins**. For example, if you need to freeze an asset under specific conditions (e.g., pending regulatory approval), you can create a custom plugin.

```javascript
/**
 * Example of creating a custom freeze delegate plugin
 */
const customFreezeDelegatePlugin = {
	type: 'FreezeDelegate',
	condition: 'Pending regulatory approval',
	freezeOnConditionMet: true
};

await updateAsset(umi, {
	asset: assetSigner,
	plugins: [customFreezeDelegatePlugin]
}).sendAndConfirm(umi);
```

You can combine this with other plugins to achieve more complex behaviors, such as freezing an asset during an infringement dispute or applying dynamic royalties based on region.

---

### 8. Regulatory Integration with WIPO and ARIPO

The platform will integrate with regulatory bodies like WIPO and ARIPO to:

1. **Verify uniqueness**: Ensure that the trademark or copyright being minted doesn’t already exist.
2. **File registrations**: After the asset is created on-chain, it needs to be filed with the relevant body.

#### 8.1 Pre-Mint Verification with WIPO/ARIPO

Before minting, the system checks with WIPO or ARIPO via API to verify whether the IP already exists.

**Endpoint**: `POST /trademarks/verify`

- **Description**: Verify the existence of an IP asset before minting with WIPO or ARIPO.

#### **Flow Diagram**:

```plaintext
User Request → API → WIPO/ARIPO Verification → Response → Proceed with Minting
```

#### 8.2 Filing After Minting

Once the asset is minted, the platform will file the IP with the appropriate regulatory body.

**Endpoint**: `POST /trademarks/{asset_id}/file`

- **Description**: File the minted trademark with the relevant body.

---

### Final System Architecture Overview

#### **System Components**:

- **Frontend**: User interface for IP holders to manage their assets and file reports.
- **API Layer**: Handles requests from the frontend and integrates with Metaplex SDK and regulatory APIs (WIPO/ARIPO).
- **Blockchain Layer**: Solana blockchain for minting and managing assets.
- **Regulatory APIs**: External APIs for verification and filing with WIPO/ARIPO.
